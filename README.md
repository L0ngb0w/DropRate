# Drop Rate
*By Bue Vedel-Larsen*

An addon for World of Warcraft Classic.

Drop Rate records the drop rates of items and display them in the unit tooltip. Use it to track how often that quest item or trade skill ingredient drop.

## How it works
Drop Rate monitors the loot you receive, counting how many times a unit drops an item. The drop rate is shared between all characters on a server, so the more you play, the more accurate the drop rate becomes.

## Limitations
Drop Rate **only** works with World of Warcraft Classic! Drop Rate works by recording the which unit the player is targeting when looting, but in retail WoW the player will automatically loot all units in an area. That makes it impossible to work out which unit a loot item came from.

Drop Rate does not record loot rolls that come from other players in your party. It is not possible to determine which unit the loot comes from when it is not the player who is looting.
